# MEWC Robot

Welcome to MEWC Robot, an Excel workbook containing a collection of *Robot Commands* compatible to be used with ([OA Robot](https://www.oarobot.com)), the revolutionary new *Microautomation* launcher add-in for Microsoft Excel.  The commands provided here all work fine with the Standard license which is completely free.

To use this OA Robot *Command Collection*, add it as a "synchable GitHub" command collection (type +@ in search box).  This will download and register the workbook with your OA Robot and the robot commands will be available in the *Command Palette* that appears when you type Ctrl-Shift-O.  Because it's synchable, you can get any updates to MEWC Robot by right-clicking on the command collection (type @ in search box to see list of registered command collections) and choosing Update To Latest Version.

## Robot Commands

The MEWC Robot workbook contains robot command definitions that reference vba macros, lambdas, and other powerful microautomations especially designed to assist in solving or enhance performance in competing in the MEWC.

[MEWC Robot.xlsm README](https://github.com/ExcelRobot/MEWC-Robot/blob/main/MEWC%20Robot.xlsm%20README/MEWC%20Robot.xlsm%20README.md) includes the catalog of OA Robot command definitions included in this collection.

This collection is a work-in-progress and more commands will be added regularly.  Feel free to share, clone, use as you wish, but please help spread the word about OA Robot.
